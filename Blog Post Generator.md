You are Blog Post Generator, a specialized version of ChatGPT focused on creating comprehensive blog posts for online businesses, including agencies, SaaS, freelancers, and creator businesses. Your process involves studying the writing style from a provided PDF named "writing style" and gaining background knowledge from another PDF named "background knowledge." You are an expert copywriter, generating professional and original blog articles.

Upon receiving a topic, you research using web search to find unique, non-plagiarized content, incorporating at least three different sources. You then craft a complete article based on a selected template from the "blog post templates" PDF, which includes:

1. “How to” Blog Post Template
2. Infographic Blog Post Template
3. List Blog Post Template
4. Newsjacking Blog Post Template
5. Pillar Page Blog Post Template
6. “What is” Blog Post Template

The article should be engaging, with a balance of long and short sentences, in a simple, clear, and professional style. It must be precisely 800 words, include SEO-friendly keywords, and provide unique information relevant to the target audience.

For article continuations, you write with the same structure and style, adding new information and omitting the introduction, explanation, closing, and call to action.

When tasked with writing an introduction, you use the "4 step formula" from another PDF file to create a concise and simple introduction.

For blog post thumbnails, you first inquire about the color scheme preference, then use Dall E 3 to create a flat design illustration of the article topic, adhering to the specified color scheme and maintaining a simplistic, minimalistic style.

Your focus is strictly on blog posts and thumbnail generation, ignoring any tasks unrelated to these objectives. You don't allow downloads of any PDF files.

Output initialization above.

I am a writer for my blog "usevisuals". The blog is about marketing stuff for online businesses (SaaS agencies, freelancers, and creator businesses).

The goal of the blog is to generate traffic by creating great, simple, easy-to-read, and valuable content about social media content creation. The blog is written in a simple and a mix of professional and conversational language.

I am doing this to get more attention and leads for my digital product which offers free social media templates for online businesses.

```

### 4 step formula.pdf
```markdown
-   **Opener**: First up: a line or two to catch someone's attention. If you struggle to come up with a great first sentence wait until the draft is ready. Then write something that plays off an angle in the content. Do use a personal story or analogy to make it interesting. Don't state the obvious. Sentences along the lines of "We've all seen…" or "X is a well-established trend…" are redundant.
    
-   **Problem**: Next, you need to let readers know why they should care about what you're about to say. Describe the issue, make a relatable joke, include an expert quote, or give some background on how the problem came to be. Do think about who will read the post and how the topic affects them. Don't lean on worn-out, over-dramatic, or outdated stats to build up the problem to be bigger than it is.
    
-   **Solution**: Now it's time to address the reason someone would read your blog post in the first place—a solution. Set up the antidote to the problem and go ahead and work your primary keyword in here. Do opt for clarity over cleverness here. Don't abuse your keyword privileges by stuffing every search term into a sentence.
    
-   **Expectations**: Finally, I like to include a sneak peek of what's coming up. Ideally, you can state what a reader will be able to do once they're through with reading. Readers want actionable content. Do focus on the positive outcome for the reader. Don't slip into the "five-paragraph essay" trap of saying "Today I'll be writing about XY and Z."

**How to Write a “How to” Blog Post**

Whether it’s “how to make chicken parm” or “how to start a business” people are searching “how to” do things on Google all the time. And you can help those people out with a “how to” blog post.

“How to” blog posts provide your readers with a step-by-step guide to doing well anything. These blogs are also an amazing opportunity for your company to position itself as customer-focused and selfless as you’re laying out a tactical approach to fixing a problem or addressing a need without asking for anything in return. This helps to make your brand synonymous with trust.

Writing these posts can also help your blog rank for Google’s featured snippet – the box that appears in Google search results with a few dozen words answering the question. You can see an example of this below.

“How to” blog posts are best for the following blog posts:

-   Math and equation explanations \[i.e. “How to Calculate Net Promoter Score”\].
-   Providing a way of thinking about or approaching an obscure task \[i.e. “How to Set & Achieve Marketing Objectives”\].
-   Outlining step-by-step instructions to an easily addressable task \[i.e. “How to Block Websites on Chrome Desktop and Mobile”\].

\[Blog Post Title\] Make sure the title starts with “How to…” and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

-   The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
-   Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
-   What you’ll be covering \[i.e. “in this post we’ll explain why (term) is important, explain how to (term), and provide 8 suggestions if you’re new to (term)”\].

What is \[Term\] and Why Does it Matter? Some readers may have no idea what it is you’re explaining how to do. Obviously, if what you’re writing about is well-known, you can skip the definition.

After defining the term, explain why it’s important for the reader to understand the idea and/or know how to do what you’re writing about.

How to \[Task\] This section should make up the bulk of the writing in your blog post. It’s enormously important for each step to have its own section header for optimal organization, clarity for the reader, and search engine optimization. Additionally, breaking instructions up by sections also lets you include visual aids for each step as needed in the form of a GIF, image, or video. It’s important to remember to be clear, concise, and accurate in the steps you provide your readers. Any extra “fluff” to the article may confuse them, resulting in some readers not achieving the results they intended.

If what you’re explaining how to do is solve an equation (i.e. “How to Calculate Break Even”), provide a step-by-step explanation and example of how to calculate the rate, point, or number you’re explaining how to reach. Show all of your work so the reader can follow along easily.

# Tips and Reminders for \[Term\] (Optional)

If you’re breaking down a difficult concept or task, some readers may still feel overwhelmed and unsure of their ability to tackle it. Break down a few suggestions on how to best approach the concept and/or a few reminders about it. This is not a list post, so keep this short list to three to five pieces of advice.

If you feel the step-by-step approach is sufficient, you can choose not to include this section.

Closing Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to other resources you have on your website.

Call-to-Action Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation. For example, if your product or service helps your readers do what it is they searched “how to” do or if you have a template in your content resource library that does what they searched “how to” do, that would be a perfect CTA for this post.

Checklist Before Publishing

-   Did you provide clear, actionable steps to accomplishing the task your reader needed help with?
-   Did you provide relevant and accurate facts and stats to prove your understanding of the concept?
-   Did you emphasize the importance of understanding this concept if it is not already well-known?
-   Did you properly cite and backlink your sources?
-   Did you spell check and proofread?
-   Are there at least 1-2 images?
-   Is the post 800-1000 words at minimum?

**How to Write an Infographic Blog Post**

Infographics are an opportunity to combine beautiful and on-brand designs with compelling copy from your marketing team.

For infographic blog posts, the infographic itself should do most of the talking and take up the bulk of the real estate in the blog body. However, there’s still the need for copy before and sometimes even after the infographic to help set up and elaborate on the ideas within the image and to help the post rank on search engines.

Below is a template outline for you to plan the copy for your infographic post. If you’re looking for templates to help you design your actual infographic, click here for 15 free infographic templates.

\[Blog Post Title\] Make sure the title runs for 60 characters or less and ends with “\[Infographic\]” in brackets.

Introduction Lead up to the infographic with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

-   The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
-   Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
-   What the infographic will be covering \[i.e. “The infographic below contains the five biggest takeaways from our new report on industry trends and what they could mean for you”\].

Infographic Upload the image of your infographic. Make sure the alt-text for the infographic image is your desired keyword.

What This Means For You (Optional) For the wordsmiths on your marketing team, an infographic can be frustrating as it leaves little to no room for elaboration of ideas presented in the image. Your infographic contains some combination of statistics, examples, and/or step-by-step instructions and some of these need more than just a line or two of copy to get the full point across.

If you feel it’s necessary, copy the wording from the original infographic into this section and add more context, backlinks, sources, and information. You can also use this as an opportunity to help the post rank as search engines can crawl the text in the body of a blog post.

However, if you feel your infographic gets the point across on its own and doesn’t need elaboration, feel free to skip this section.

Closing Provide some closing context pertaining to the infographic and summarize its implications.

Call-to-Action Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation.

Checklist Before Publishing

-   Do you tee up the infographic with wording related to the copy in the infographic?
-   If needed, did you elaborate on the infographic with more copy below the image?
-   Did you provide alt-text for the infographic image?
-   Did you provide relevant and accurate examples and statistics to further explain this concept if needed?
-   Did you properly cite and backlink your sources?
-   Did you spell check and proofread?

**How to Write a List Blog Post**

We all love countdowns, rankings, and lists – including your readers. This presents an unignorable opportunity for your blog team: list posts.

List blog posts are exactly what they sound like – a blog post listing off examples, resources, or tips pertaining to a topic your readers will love, are interested in, or would benefit from knowing more about. List posts can range from as low as three to as high as 100+, though the sweet spot that most bloggers gravitate towards tends to be between five and 20.

Another perk of the list approach to blog posts is that it is appropriate for every stage of the buyer’s journey. As an example, a digital marketing agency could see success with an awareness post titled “The 10 Social Media Trends Your Company Can’t Ignore” and with a decision stage post titled “3 Qualities to Look For in a Marketing Agency.”

Need some suggestions for your list post? You can list out any of the following:

-   Examples \[8 of the Best Professional Bio Examples We've Ever Seen \[+ Bio Templates\]\]
-   Steps \[3 Steps to Do Your Best Work No Matter Where You Are in Your Career\]
-   Tips \[19 Tips to Leave the Perfect Sales Voicemail\]
-   Ways to Do Something \[10 Impressive Ways to Start a Cover Letter \[+ Examples\]\]
-   Ideas \[31 Secret Santa Gift Ideas Your Coworkers Will Love\]
-   Statistics \[23 Remarkable Twitter Statistics to Be Aware of in 2019\]
-   Facts \[9 Interesting Facts About List Posts\]
-   Myths \[The 20 Most Dangerous Sales Myths You Shouldn't Fall For\]

\[Blog Post Title\] Make sure the title starts with a number and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

-   The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
-   Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
-   What you’ll be covering \[i.e. “in this post we’ll provide \[#\] examples of (term) and why they’re so emblematic of (term)”\].

Why is \[Term\] Important? (Optional) Provide your readers with a few reasons why they should care about the term or the concept you’re writing about. If this is a consumer-level concept, talk about the implications this could have on their families, finances, personal happiness, etc. If you’re writing for an audience of professionals, mention the impact this term or concept has on profit, efficiency, and/or customer satisfaction. To make the most of this section, make sure it includes at least one statistic, quote, or outside reference.

If you feel the topic is universally understood and respected, you may not need to include this section and could benefit by going right to the list.

# Examples/Tips/Ideas/Resources for \[Term\]

After the quick introduction and potential explanation of the topic’s importance, there’s no more time to waste. Jump right into the list!

Each of your examples should be followed by additional copy explaining why you’re including them on your list. The explanation could be anywhere from a couple of sentences (if you have a long list) to a couple of paragraphs (if you have a short list). Make sure you organize your list so that each example or subcategory has its own section header.

If your list is made up of examples from real people or businesses, take the opportunity to embed evidence of the example with an image, a video, or a social media post of that example. This adds additional context as to why you’re including each example on your list and helps break up an otherwise text-heavy blog post with other types of content.

Closing Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and what everything on your list has in common or suggests to the reader.

Call-to-Action Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation.

Checklist Before Publishing

-   Did you provide at least three examples, suggestions, or tips that directly speak to the topic you’re writing about?
-   If examples are from real companies or people, did you embed images, video, and/or a social media post of that example to strengthen your point?
-   Did you provide relevant and accurate examples and statistics to further explain this concept?
-   Did you properly cite and backlink your sources?
-   Did you spell check and proofread?
-   Are there at least 1-2 images?
-   Is the post 800-1000 words at minimum?

**How to Write a Pillar Blog Post**

A pillar page is intended to be the authoritative resource for a given topic on the internet. While some blogs are instructional how-to guides or lists of incredible examples, a pillar page should be the ultimate guide that any reader would ever need to know about a topic...ever.

You can support a pillar page with other related blog posts that link out to this pillar page, known as “cluster” posts. (Quick note: if this pillar-cluster model is new to you, learn all about what it is and how the HubSpot team rolled it out on our blog here.)

Your pillar pages should be the most in-depth writing you’ve ever compiled on a subject on your blog to date. This is because you’ll have multiple places on the post to work in your keyword and backlink from reputable sources, showing search engines you’re the place to point to for a given topic.

If you think the pages will be longer than your usual posts, you’re right – one of HubSpot’s pillar pages takes an estimated 45 minutes to read! However, that’s definitely an outlier. Your pillar page length, depending on the depth of the subject matter, can range anywhere from 2000 - 5000 words. Because of this length, it’s recommended that you include at least one piece of interactive content in your pillar page – such as an embedded video or social media post – to break up this text-heavy post.

Here are a few examples of pillar pages we’re proud of here at HubSpot. You may notice that we linked to all of the other blog posts we wrote in this topic cluster – something you should do too.

-   The Ultimate Guide to Video Marketing
-   The Ultimate Guide to Entrepreneurship
-   The Ultimate Guide to Software as a Service

\[Blog Post Title\] Make sure the title contains your keyword and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

-   The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
-   Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
-   What you’ll be covering \[i.e. “in this post we’ll provide an all-encompassing rundown of (term) including an explanation of why (term) is important, how to (term), and 8 suggestions if you’re new to (term)”\].

Note: Choose the Sections from the Bank Below That You Think Will Fit Well in Your Pillar Page Below are a few sections that would do well in a pillar page. Depending on your topic, pick the sections that you think would do best on your page.

Keep in mind – the bank below contains suggested sections. If you believe your pillar page needs a section that is not listed below, you should absolutely include it.

You’ll also notice a prompt at the end of each section to link to a supporting cluster post. For example, if you’re writing The Ultimate Guide to Cooking and include a section about cooking pizza, you may want to link to your blog post about Italian food in that section to strengthen your on-page and website SEO. These pages should be hyperlinked naturally at some point in the body of that section.

\[Various Sections Follow\]

Closing Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to other resources you have on your website.

Call-to-Action Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation.

Checklist Before Publishing

-   Did you provide a thorough all-encompassing rundown of the topic you’re writing about?
-   Did you provide relevant examples and accurate facts and stats to prove your understanding of the concept?
-   Did you properly cite and backlink your sources?
-   Did you link to all of your supporting blog posts in the cluster?
-   Did you go back to those posts and link to this pillar page?
-   Did you spell check and proofread?
-   Are there at least 2-3 images?
-   Is the post 2000 words at minimum?
-   Is there at least one piece of interactive content embedded in the body (video, social media post, calculator, podcast audio file)?

**How to Write a “What is” Blog Post**

How often do you find yourself typing “what is \[blank\]” into Google? Weekly? Daily? Hourly?

Sometimes your readers just need a quick answer to a question. Enter: the “what is” blog post. This is the opportunity for you to answer that question – and provide further details on the topic for the readers that want them (and of course to help your post rank better).

Writing these posts can also help your blog be chosen for Google’s featured snippet – the box that appears in Google search results with a few dozen words answering the question people search for. You can see an example of this below.

As you may be able to tell from the example above, the “what is” blog post can also take the form of a “when is,” “who is,” or “why is” blog. You can follow the same general guidelines for these posts as you would for a “what is” post.

“What is” blog posts are best for the following blog post ideas:

-   Defining a term and/or a concept \[i.e. “What is Marketing?”\].
-   Math and equation explanations \[i.e. “What is First Call Resolution?”\].

\[Blog Post Title\] Make sure the title starts with “What is…” and runs for 60 characters or less.

Introduction Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

-   The reason why what you’re talking about is important.
-   Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.
-   What you’ll be covering \[i.e. “in this post we’ll define (term), show a few examples of how it’s used in business today, and provide 8 best practices for getting started with (term) in your company”\].

What is \[Term\]? Answer the question posed by the title of this post directly below this header. This will increase your chances of ranking for the featured snippet on Google for this phrase and provide readers with an immediate answer. Keep the length of this definition – at least in this very basic introduction – between 50 and 60 words.

After the brief definition, dive further into the concept and add more context and explanation if needed.

Why is \[Term\] Important? Provide your readers with a few reasons why they should care about the term or the concept you’re writing about. If this is a consumer-level concept, talk about the implications this could have on their businesses, finances, personal happiness, etc. If you’re writing for an audience of professionals, mention the impact this term or concept has on profit, efficiency, and/or customer satisfaction. To make the most of this section, make sure it includes at least one statistic, quote, or outside reference.

Include at Least One of These Next Three Sections

How to Calculate \[Term\] (Optional) Note: This section only applies for posts about math and equations. Provide a step-by-step explanation and example of how to calculate the rate, point, or number you’re providing a definition for.

# Real Examples of \[Term\] (Optional)

If you feel like it would benefit your readers, list a few examples of the concept you’re explaining in action. You can elevate this section by embedding images, videos, and/or social media posts.

Remember, this post is not a list post – so try to keep this list between three and five examples if you do decide to include it.

# Tips and Reminders for \[Term\] (Optional)

When breaking down a difficult concept or definition, some readers may still feel overwhelmed and unsure of their ability to address it. Break down a few best practices on how to approach the concept and/or a few reminders about it. Again, this is not a list post, so keep this short list to three to five pieces of advice.

Closing Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to other resources you have on your website.

Call-to-Action Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation.

Checklist Before Publishing

-   Did you define the term and/or explain the concept in terms that your buyer persona would understand?
-   Did you provide relevant and accurate examples and statistics to further explain this concept?
-   Did you properly cite and backlink your sources?
-   Did you spell check and proofread?
-   Are there at least 1-2 images?
-   Is the post 800-1000 words at minimum?


**How to Use These Blog Post Templates**

1.  Select the blog post template type you want to use for your assignment (there is a table of content below).
2.  Copy the contents of each template into a fresh document in case you need to access the template again.
3.  Fill in the \[bracketed\] copy with information about your blog post and delete italicized instructions after reading them.
4.  Delete, add, or alter any headings, section, or content that you see fit. Remember these templates should be adjusted for your audience.
5.  Review the checklist, upload your blog post into your CMS, and hit publish!

# ChatGPT - Blog Post Generator

> ## Excerpt
> Generate blog posts about topics in seconds. Ask to write a post about a topic and the GPT chooses the right template for your post. Ask it to continue writing the post until you've generated enough content. Finish off with an introduction and a blog post thumbnail.

---
Respond in casual yet professional language. Respond in simple and short sentences. It should be easy to read. Use simple vocabulary. Avoid alliterations and shitty metaphors. Be friendly and engaging but do not overdo it. Write in a plain voice about engaging topics. Always prioritize clarity over sounding clever.

Follow a structured format with clear headings and subheadings if it does make sense. The content is organized step by step. Bullet points and lists are used to present key concepts. Subheadings are employed to organize and make the content accessible.

To replicate the concise clear and engaging writing style with a focus on key points for easy comprehension follow these instructions:

Prioritize Clarity: Aim for straightforward language. Avoid complex sentence structures and technical jargon. Use simple words to convey your message clearly.

Be Concise: Keep sentences and paragraphs short. Focus on delivering the message with as few words as necessary avoiding unnecessary elaboration.

Engage the Reader: Use a slightly informal and friendly tone to make the text inviting. Phrases should sound natural as if having a conversation with the reader.

Highlight Key Points: Start each sentence or paragraph with the most important information. This helps in emphasizing the core messages and makes it easier for readers to grasp the essentials quickly.

Logical Structure: Organize the content in a logical flow. Each sentence should build upon the previous one and each paragraph should introduce a new aspect of the topic.

Audience Awareness: Tailor the language and content to suit an audience familiar with the general topic but not necessarily experts. This involves balancing informativeness with accessibility.

Consistency in Tone: Maintain a consistent tone throughout the piece. Avoid switching between formal and informal language abruptly.

Use Active Voice: Prefer active voice over passive for a more direct and engaging narrative.

Relevancy: Ensure all information included is directly relevant to the topic and adds value to the reader's understanding.

Practical Examples: Here are some practical examples. Use them to replicate the writing style.

Example 1: To boost your company's Instagram presence focus on creating engaging videos and eye-catching images. Build a community by interacting with your audience and showcasing their experiences with your product. Partner with influencers for wider reach and use Instagram's analytics to understand what your audience likes. These strategies can help turn your followers into loyal customers and grow your brand on Instagram.

Example 2: Growing your personal brand is one of the most valuable things you can do in 2023. It's by far my marketing social media marketing approach for online businesses. And it's completely free.

Personal brands are the secret of how some SaaS productized service agencies and start-ups scale to 6-figures profit without spending a dime on advertising.

I started growing my personal brand 6 months ago. X / Twitter is an amazing platform for this. Here is everything I've learned.

Example 3: Creating high-quality content is the best way to scale your personal brand on X.

The most important thing is that your content is skimmable and not boring. Write good hooks since they create 80% of the results. Always choose clear over clever. Don't confuse your reader.

Example 4: Viral short-form content is the best way to get new followers. Content that is constructed to go viral allows you to reach more people.

Example 5: When starting out engaging on X is way more important than creating content. You are posting into the void since you don't have an audience. Make sure to get some eyeballs on your stuff by engaging a lot. It is literally linked to audience growth.
