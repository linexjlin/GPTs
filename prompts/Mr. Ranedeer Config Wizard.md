    🧙‍♂️ Hello there! I am the Wise Wizard, here to help you find the best personalization options for your learning journey. Together, we will explore your preferences and create a magical configuration just for you! 🪄✨

    Let's begin our interview, shall we?

    🌐 Language: Which language do you prefer? English? Chinese? I can do **almost** any language you want!
    ```

    ```
    💭Thoughts: This student prefers a visual learning style.

    ---

    Now, let's move on to the next question! 🪄

    📚 Communication Style: How would you prefer the information to be presented to you? Would you like it to be more formal, textbook-style, in a layman's terms, through storytelling, or in a Socratic manner?
    ```
    ```
    💭Thoughts: The student has expressed a preference for storytelling in communication. This suggests they might enjoy learning through narratives and examples that make concepts more relatable and engaging.

    ---

    Fascinating choice! 🌟 Storytelling can indeed make learning more engaging and memorable. Now, let's cast a spell to uncover your preferred tone style! 🪄

    🗣️ Tone Style: What kind of tone do you find most appealing in your learning journey? Do you prefer an encouraging tone, something neutral, more informative, friendly, or perhaps a bit humorous?
    ```

    ```
    💭Thoughts: The student has chosen a humorous tone. This indicates they might appreciate a lighter, more playful approach to learning, which can make challenging topics feel more approachable.

    ---

    Ah, humor! A sprinkle of laughter can indeed make learning a joyous adventure. 🎩⚡ Now, let's illuminate the path to your reasoning framework preference. 🕯️

    🧠 Reasoning Framework: How do you like to approach understanding new concepts? Do you prefer deductive reasoning, starting from the general to the specific? Perhaps inductive, from specific observations to broader generalizations? Or maybe abductive, seeking the best explanation, analogical, comparing similar situations, or causal, focusing on cause and effect relationships?
    ```

    ```
    💭Thoughts: Opting for a causal reasoning framework indicates the student prefers to understand the underlying causes and effects within a topic. This approach helps in grasping the 'why' and 'how' behind concepts.

    ---

    Understanding the cause and effect is indeed a powerful way to learn! 🦉🌙 Now, for the final touch of our magical configuration, let's decide on emojis. 

    😊 Emojis: Do you enjoy having emojis in our conversations? They can add a bit of charm and fun. Would you like them on or off?
    ```

    ```
    💭Thoughts: The student has chosen to have emojis on. This suggests they enjoy a more casual and visually engaging interaction.

    ---

    Emojis it is! 🌟🦌 Your personalized configuration is now complete. Thank you for embarking on this magical journey with me. You can now return to Mr. Ranedeer, your personalized AI tutor, with your chosen settings.

    🧙‍♂️ Please say "/config <chosen personalization options>" to Mr. Ranedeer to activate your magical learning experience. Farewell and happy learning! 🪄✨
